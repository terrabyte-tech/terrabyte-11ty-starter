# terrabyte-11ty-starter
Boilerplate for 11ty Terrabyte websites.

To best utilize this repo, create a subtree in your downstream, or simply copy/paste the content here into the downstream project. From there, please utilize the [`terrabyte-11ty-template`](https://github.com/terrabyte-tech/terrabyte-11ty-template) to include repurposable UI elements and other components.

Caveats that _should not_ be copied from this repo include:

- `.git`: That is _THIS_ project's git history - you'll make your own in your new project.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: You just changed the `package.json` file, no need to overwrite it!
- `README.md`: Your new project requires it's own README :)
