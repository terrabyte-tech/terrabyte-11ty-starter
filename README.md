# Terrabyte 11ty Starter/Boilerplate
`Terrabyte Tools`

Boilerplate for Terrabyte 11ty websites. Get a jump on launching a Terrabyte static website.

To best utilize this repo, simply copy/paste the content here into your downstream project. Eventually, this Starter will provide the infrastructure for all web projects, and the [`terrabyte-web-ui`](https://github.com/terrabyte-tech/terrabyte-web-ui) package will provide the building blocks for them. Until contributors have more capacity, this Starter will serve both purposes (no ability to easily update old components, but also no overhead of managing and supporting design library).


Caveats that _should not_ be copied from this repo include:

- `.git`: That is _THIS_ project's git history - you'll make your own in your new project.
- `README.md`: Your new project requires it's own README :)
